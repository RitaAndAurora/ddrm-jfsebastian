# J.F. Sebastian - User Manual


## Overview

J. F. Sebastian, named after a former genetic designer of the *Tyrell Corporation*, provides new ways to control and explore the sonic possibilities of the CS80-inspired Deckard's Dream synthesiser (DDRM). It works both as a **stand-alone app** and as an **audio plug-in**.

J.F. Sebastian interfaces with the DDRM and turns its sliders into audio plugin parameters that can be *modulated and automated* from your DAW. With J.F. Sebastian you can import DDRM bank files, edit patches and export them. When you import a bank file, a *timbre Space* will be created which will allow you to navigate all the presets in a colorful space and create new ones. J.F. Sebastian also includes a *CS80-like tone selector* that allows you to use the original presetting system of the CS80 in the DDRM.

Here is a screenshot of J.F. Sebastian with the different parts of the interface highlighted. The sections below describe each one of them.

## Credits and acknowledgements

J.F. Sebastian has been ideated and developed by [Rita & Aurora](), a sort of fancy branding name I've given to my audio-developer [self](https://ffont.github.io).

Enormous thanks to Paul Shiling for creating the great CS80 presets bank that has been used for the tone selector. Also thanks to Black Corporation for making such a great synth!
